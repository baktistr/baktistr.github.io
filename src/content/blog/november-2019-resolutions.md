I've been reflecting on my previous goal-setting attempts. While having long-term objectives like pursuing OSCP certification, I've struggled with motivation and clarity about what truly matters to me. I've experienced periods of mental difficulty and social anxiety.

## The Core Realization

I realize what makes me really happy is by achieving something what I want—it doesn't have to be something big.

Building daily habits through small, achievable tasks is the key. Celebrating small wins—whether recognition or self-rewards—provides meaningful satisfaction.

## November Goals

1. Wake early and exercise before work
2. Complete one book (Sapiens by Harari)
3. Cook personal meals
4. Finish basic Android and data science courses with certificates
5. Exercise on office treadmills after work

## Final Thoughts

Personal motivation stems from within. Doubt shouldn't prevent forward momentum.

Environmental support matters, but ultimately we define our own paths. Keep making consistent effort toward your chosen goals.
