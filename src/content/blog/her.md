## January 2020 - Jakarta

I met her at a coffee shop in Jakarta. She wore a pale yellow dress and carried a navy handbag while sipping a matcha latte.

We talked about the book "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker.

## July 2020 - Bandung

By July, our relationship had evolved. Despite appearing tired, she greeted me with the best smile I've ever seen. She wore an elegant white dress and a protective mask.

That day marked our wedding.

Thank you for talking with me in that small coffee shop.

Thank you for finding me in this vast universe.

To my wife, @sitifristekawati—

**Love you always.**
