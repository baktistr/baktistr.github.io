As 2019 comes to a close, I want to express my gratitude for everyone whose lives intersected with mine throughout the year.

## Reflecting on 2019

While 2019 wasn't dramatically different from previous years, a pilgrimage to Mecca for umrah significantly helped me endure the year.

Looking back at my college days, I can identify persistent negative habits—particularly avoiding extra effort in work and studies while struggling with socialization. These have been barriers preventing me from fully achieving my goals. I regret maintaining these patterns into adulthood.

## Goals for 2020

For the new year, I'm setting these aspirational goals:
- Tracking all of my money
- Start doing exercises
- Reading more books
- Doing some research and online courses
- Pursuing certification

## The Pomodoro Technique

I discovered the Pomodoro technique this year—a time-management approach that has helped me accomplish tasks throughout the year. Highly recommended for anyone struggling with focus and productivity.

Goodbye 2019, and welcome 2020!

Be nice to me!!
