It's been a while since I last shared an update—my last post was in January 2023. A lot has changed since then, and I wanted to take a moment to reflect on where I am now.

## Career Move to Cybersecurity

I've transitioned to the CYS (cybersecurity division) at my workplace. It's been a mental shift—new spaces bring a fresh wave of inspiration. This move fulfills a long-held aspiration dating back to 2020 when I won an internal cybersecurity competition.

The transition has reignited my pursuit of OSCP certification and includes engagement with Hack The Box challenges. It feels like I'm finally on the path I've always wanted to be on.

## Advanced Degree Pursuits

I'm applying to Master's programs at top-ranked universities globally, motivated by securing a full scholarship from my employer. I need a Letter of Acceptance (LOA) from one of these universities ASAP this year.

The application process involves:
- Preparing for IELTS, GMAT, and GRE examinations
- Gathering recommendation letters
- Crafting personal statements

## Personal Impact

These changes significantly affect family circumstances, particularly regarding my wife and four-year-old daughter. I've experienced rejections along the way, but I'm maintaining optimism about the journey's lessons regarding patience, perseverance, and believing in my own potential.

Here's to new beginnings and continued growth.
