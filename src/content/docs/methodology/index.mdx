# Methodology

This section contains penetration testing methodologies, frameworks, and systematic approaches used during security assessments.

## Overview

Penetration testing methodologies provide structured approaches to identifying vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. Following a systematic methodology ensures comprehensive coverage and consistent results.

### Key Phases

Most penetration tests follow these core phases:

1. **Reconnaissance** - Information gathering and target analysis
2. **Scanning** - Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities
3. **Enumeration** - Deep-dive into discovered services
4. **Exploitation** - Gaining access through identified vulnerabilities
5. **Post-Exploitation** - Determining the value of compromised systems
6. **Reporting** - Documenting findings and recommendations
