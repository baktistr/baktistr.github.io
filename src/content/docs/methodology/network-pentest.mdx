# Network Penetration Testing Methodology

A structured methodology is essential for thorough and professional penetration testing.

## 1. Pre-Engagement

### Scope Definition
- Define targets (IP ranges, domains)
- Identify testing windows
- Establish rules of engagement
- Document exclusions

### Legal Authorization
- Get written permission
- Define contact information
- Emergency procedures

## 2. Reconnaissance

### Passive Reconnaissance
```bash
# WHOIS lookups
whois target.com

# DNS enumeration
nslookup target.com
dig target.com ANY

# Search engine research
google dorking
shodan search
```

### Active Reconnaissance
```bash
# Port scanning
nmap -sS -T4 target.com

# Service enumeration
nmap -sV -sC target.com

# Banner grabbing
netcat, telnet
```

## 3. Enumeration

### Host Enumeration
- Open ports and services
- OS fingerprinting
- Service versions

### Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Nessus
# OpenVAS
# Nuclei
nuclei -u https://target.com
```

## 4. Exploitation

### Manual Exploitation
- Searchsploit for public exploits
- Metasploit Framework
- Custom exploits
- Social engineering

### Automated Tools
- Metasploit
- SQLmap
- Hydra (password attacks)

## 5. Post-Exploitation

### Privilege Escalation
```bash
# Linux enumeration
LinEnum.sh
LinPEAS

# Windows enumeration
PowerShell Empire
WinPEAS
```

### Lateral Movement
- Credential dumping
- Pivot through compromised hosts
- Exploit trust relationships

## 6. Persistence

### Backdoors
- Web shells
- SSH keys
- Scheduled tasks
- Services

## 7. Reporting

### Executive Summary
- High-level overview
- Business impact
- Risk ratings

### Technical Details
- Vulnerability details
- Exploitation steps
- Evidence/screenshots
- Remediation recommendations

## Best Practices

- Document everything
- Keep detailed timestamps
- Maintain chain of custody
- Respect scope boundaries
- Communicate findings clearly

<Callout type="success">
Professional penetration testing requires thorough documentation and clear communication of findings to stakeholders.
