# Differential Privacy for Dummies

A beginner-friendly introduction to understanding differential privacy and its applications.

## What is Differential Privacy?

Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that provides formal guarantees about the privacy of individuals in a dataset, even when statistical queries are made against that dataset.

## Key Concepts

### The Privacy Parameter (ε)

The epsilon (ε) parameter controls the privacy-utility tradeoff:
- **Lower ε** = More privacy, less accuracy
- **Higher ε** = Less privacy, more accuracy

### Randomized Response

One of the simplest differential privacy mechanisms. Add controlled noise to responses to protect individual privacy.

## Applications

- Census data collection
- Machine learning model training
- Healthcare analytics
- Location data aggregation
