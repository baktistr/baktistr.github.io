# Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)

An overview of techniques and approaches for training and deploying machine learning models while preserving data privacy.

## Overview

Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) encompasses techniques that enable machine learning on sensitive data without compromising individual privacy.

## Key Techniques

### Federated Learning

Train models across decentralized data sources without centralizing the data.

- **Horizontal FL** - Same features, different samples
- **Vertical FL** - Same samples, different features
- **Federated Transfer Learning** - Different features and samples

### Differential Privacy

Add calibrated noise during training to provide formal privacy guarantees.

### Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)

Multiple parties jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping inputs private.

### Homomorphic Encryption

Perform computations on encrypted data without decrypting it.

## Applications

- Healthcare ML
- Financial fraud detection
- Cross-organization collaboration
- Personal data analytics

## Challenges

- Computational overhead
- Communication costs
- Privacy-utility tradeoff
- Model accuracy
