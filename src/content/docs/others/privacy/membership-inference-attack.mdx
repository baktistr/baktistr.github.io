# Membership Inference Attack

Understanding membership inference attacks - a privacy attack that determines whether a specific data point was used in training a machine learning model.

## What is a Membership Inference Attack?

A membership inference attack (MIA) is a privacy attack where an adversary attempts to determine whether a particular data record was part of the training dataset used to build a machine learning model.

## How It Works

1. **Shadow Model Training** - Train multiple models on similar data distributions
2. **Attack Model Training** - Train a classifier to distinguish member vs non-member behavior
3. **Inference** - Use the attack model to classify target records

## Why It Matters

- Privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Sensitive data exposure
- Model vulnerability assessment

## Defenses

- Differential privacy training
- Regularization techniques
- Output perturbation
- Membership inference game training
